    "description": "Breakout is your basic Pong game, except you use the Leap Motion controller to track your hand movement. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. Get extra points for multiple rebounds in a row!",
